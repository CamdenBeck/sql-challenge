# sql-challenge

## Project Overview
This project involves designing a database for a fictional company to store and analyze employee data. The goal is to create an efficient database schema, populate it with sample data, and write SQL queries to answer specific business questions.

## Tools and Technologies
- PostgreSQL
- pgAdmin
- SQL

## Steps Taken
1. **Database Design**: Created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to model the database structure.
2. **Schema Creation**: Wrote SQL scripts to define the database schema, including tables, relationships, and constraints.
3. **Data Insertion**: Populated the database with sample data provided in the project files.
4. **Query Writing**: Developed SQL queries to extract insights and answer the assigned questions.

## Files in the Repository
- `data/`: Contains the data files and the ERD image.
- `schema.sql`: SQL script to create the database schema.
- `query.sql`: SQL queries for the assigned tasks.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `schema.sql` file in your SQL editor and execute it to create the database.
3. Load the sample data into the database.
4. Run the queries in `query.sql` to analyze the data.

## References
The data used in this project and an image of the Entity Relationship Diagram are located in the data folder.
The schema for the database is in the schema.sql file.
The queries that were assigned are located in the query.sql file.
